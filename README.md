# A Chat Server Story

starting from a dinosaur, will make chat server better and better progressively (whenever I feel like!)

the last version will be in the src/legacy dir and maybe i'll make branches idk we'll figure it out

NEXT:
- adding sqlite or maybe redis to store clients or maybe my own concurrent database
- ban mfs
- timeout after a message
